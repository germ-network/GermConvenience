//Since the HTTP spec allows for any single-word method, defining this value in Swift as an enum is incorrect, because an enum only allows for a finite number of values, but there are an infinite number of possible “single word” values. A better implementation of this is to use a struct
public struct HTTPMethod: Hashable, Sendable {
	public static let get = HTTPMethod(rawValue: "GET")
	public static let post = HTTPMethod(rawValue: "POST")
	public static let put = HTTPMethod(rawValue: "PUT")
	public static let delete = HTTPMethod(rawValue: "DELETE")

	public let rawValue: String
}

public struct URLScheme: Sendable {
	public static let http = URLScheme(rawValue: "http")
	public static let https = URLScheme(rawValue: "https")

	public let rawValue: String
}
